#**Random Text Assignment**

> [!TIP]
Try the program here: https://sindrebjo.github.io/random_text_assignment/random_text

This will generate 1 out of 6 jokes when the button is pressed.
Added a function to the button that generate a random number and prevents the current joke to be selected again, pretty simple.
